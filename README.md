> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some flags and options are designed for CTFs; review before using in production.

## How It Works

1. **Origins**

   - Inspired by [Whare](https://github.com/whare1) automating commands just before the *PUPPY* machine launch on Hack The Box.
   - Initial JavaScript demo by [2as](https://github.com/dos4s), later evolved under the leadership of [R1nzler](https://github.com/Marcejr117).

2. **Workflow**

   - Select module (recon, exploit, post-exploit).
   - Execute commands with preconfigured parameters.
   - Review and customize results.
