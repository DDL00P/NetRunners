## About Netrunners Toolkit

Netrunners Toolkit is designed to streamline the pentesting process and support learning along the way. It’s a versatile toolset, useful both in CTFs and real-world scenarios. However, note that many commands are optimized for CTF environments and may include flags or options not recommended for use in production systems.

Our goal is to continue improving the toolkit by adding new tools, better documentation, and expanded functionality. We welcome contributions, suggestions, or ideas from the community! (añadir link github)

## Origins

It all started when <a href="https://github.com/whare1"> Whare </a>, about 30 minutes before the release of the _PUPPY_ machine on Hack The Box, was preparing a list of all the commands he’d need based on the provided credentials. That’s when the idea hit: _why not find a way to automate this process_, similar to how automation is used in bug bounty hunting (inspired by projects like [lostsec.xyz](https://lostsec.xyz/))?

The idea was pitched to the group **NETRUNNERS**. After researching existing tools and not finding one that fully met our needs, we decided to build it ourselves.

One day, our sysadmin <a href="https://github.com/dos4s"> 2as </a> created a quick and dirty JavaScript demo, trying hard to make things work. That “raw” aesthetic and lack of scalability lit a spark in our full-stack developer  <a href="https://github.com/Marcejr117"> Rinzler </a>, who immediately stepped in and took the lead on developing the project into something serious.

## Deployment instructions

Astro Javascript Framework is required, as it is the main gear of the project. In order to properly install it refer to the official documentation <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/"> here </a>
