* 🛡️ **Pentesting**: reusable and adaptable scripts.

> ⚠️ Some flags and options are designed for CTFs; review before using in production.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Origins**

   * Inspired by [Whare](https://github.com/whare1) automating commands just before the *PUPPY* machine launch on Hack The Box.
   * Initial JavaScript demo by [2as](https://github.com/dos4s), later evolved under the leadership of [Rinzler](https://github.com/Marcejr117).

2. **Workflow**

   * Select module (recon, exploit, post-exploit).
   * Execute commands with preconfigured parameters.
   * Review and customize results.
